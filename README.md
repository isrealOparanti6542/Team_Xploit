### Overview

{APP NAME} is a revolutionary platform designed to streamline on-chain payments and empower workers with greater control over their reputation. Traditional freelancing platforms often lack transparency and put both clients and workers at risk of fraud or dishonest behavior. Our platform leverages blockchain technology to address these issues and provide a secure, transparent, and efficient environment for freelancers and clients to engage in business transactions.

#### Key Features

- **On-chain Payments**: Utilize smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent transactions between clients and workers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud.

- **Anonymity and Privacy**: Protect user privacy by enabling anonymous interactions between clients and workers while still ensuring transparency and accountability through on-chain ratings and reputation management.

- **Worker Reputation Control**: Empower workers to take control of their reputation by providing them with the ability to build and maintain their on-chain reputation, which can be accessed and verified by potential clients.

- **Deposit and Withdrawal Functionality**: Enable users to deposit funds into the platform using supported cryptocurrencies and withdraw funds securely through smart contracts.

- **Job Posting and Selection**: Allow clients to post job openings on the platform and review CVs submitted by interested workers. Clients can then select the most suitable worker for the job based on their qualifications and experience.

- **Agreement and Assignment**: Facilitate agreement between clients and workers on job terms through cryptographic signatures, and automate the assignment of jobs to selected workers through smart contracts.

- **Dispute Resolution**: Implement a fair and transparent dispute resolution mechanism that enables the platform to intervene and resolve disputes between clients and workers in cases of dishonest behavior or breach of contract.

#### Mission Statement

**DEV**

**Designer** The layout of the app is like that of a freelance platform  with a focus on designing web3 designs, another difference would be the design of a connect web3 option(there are several examples online)



**WEB2 DEVELOPER**
frontend 
classic features of a freelance website 
integrate web3 ie users should be able to connect their wallets to signup and sign messages 
users should be able to communicate with each other in a secure way 
users should be able to input job value on assignment and a message should be crafted which fits what is expected by the smart contract, said messsage will then be signed 
recommendation : read on web3.js

backend 
store user data in secure database ie (username,password,wallet address and data related to the users public image eg their stack,exp and reviews for freelancers and total completed jobs for clients)
cache of user data on login etc 

**BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPER**
implementation of all smart contracts (for the purpose of the project, the smart contract language is solidity)
notable features include 
a deposit functionality : for clients to deposit 
a withdraw functionality : for cliets to withdraw funds not allocated to any job
a assign job functionality : for clients to assign a job to a freelancer 
a finish job functionality : for freelancers to receive the reward for completing a job 

INVARIANTS 
clients must not be able to withdraw funds assigned to a job 
workers must not be able to give themselves job which the client didnt sign
